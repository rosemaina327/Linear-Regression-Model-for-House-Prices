# Linear-Regression-Model-for-House-Prices
Build a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Clean data, train model, evaluate performance, and interpret results.

Objective:
Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

Data:
You will need to collect data on house prices, square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. This data can be obtained from various sources, such as real estate websites, government databases, or academic datasets.

Model:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, removing any missing values or outliers. Normalize the data to ensure all features are on the same scale.
Split the Data: Divide the dataset into a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance. Â  

Model Training: 
Use the training set to train a linear regression model. This involves fitting the model to the data and learning the coefficients that relate the input features to the target variable (house price).

Model Evaluation:
Use the testing set to evaluate the performance of the model. Calculate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared to assess how well the model predicts the prices of houses.

Model Interpretation:
Analyze the coefficients of the model to understand the impact of each feature on house prices.
Output:

The output of this task will be a trained linear regression model that can be used to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. You can also generate visualizations to illustrate the performance of the model and the relationship between the input features and the target variable.
